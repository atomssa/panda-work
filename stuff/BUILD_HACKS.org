The following things were done to get a working compile

* Still refuse to compile boost and cmake
** they are available on system (rejected on basis of being too new)
** For boost, may reevaluate, because of lmd issue mentioned below


* For externals use gcc from homebrew instead of built in clang
** Intention was to avoid the many mac specific build failures
** Worked mostly smoothly.
** One still needs to remove rdynamic flag from pluto compilation
*** even with gcc from homebrew, rdynamic is not available on mac
*** add the following to install_pluto.sh:
    mysed  '-rdynamic' '' Makefile
** For root one has to modify the rootconfig.sh file located in tools/rootconfig.sh
*** Namely --with-cc=gcc --with-cxx=g++ --with-ld=g++ has to be added

* Had to roll back xquartz to version 2.7.4
** 2.7.6 has freetype version 1.5.1 which breaks root build with the root version provided in pandaroot
** This causes errors of the type: include/TTF.h:51:4: error: 'FT_Glyph' does not name a type
** Lots of exploration to fix it amicably but nothing worked
** One lead was to remove ftgl (because its needed in some useless 3d graph library)
*** tried a patch suggested in https://github.com/root-mirror/root/commit/446a11828dcf577efd15d9057703c5bd099dd148
*** also tried to remove from rootconfig.sh --enalble-builtin-ftgl which didn't work either


* Tried without success to use brew gcc in panda-root
** Main problem is with the use of -fPIE option to compile fortran that is externally linked in c++
*** the visible culprit was inside the DPM class where the main.cc file calls fortran funcs
*** PIE option allows adding executable in random adresses, but couldn't tell the linker to allow that
*** consult http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2463150/fpie-position-independent-executable-option-gcc-ld

* lmd class calling ptree from boost caused compile issues
** hard to solve, so commented out offending code
** source is in : md/LmdFit/LumiImpl/data/PndLmdDataFacade.cxx

* Panda root classes that link to pluto wont compile
** This is because of the issue of friend functions with default arguments
** Culprit is generators/pluto/src/PStaticData.h
** install_pluto.sh can be modified to apply the patch by adding in the osx section :
     mysed  'friend void listModes(int id=-1);' 'friend void listModes(int id);' src/PStaticData.h
     mysed  'friend void listParticle(int id=-1);' 'friend void listParticle(int id);' src/PStaticData.h

* Obscure error: inline functions are hidden for some reason
   (invisible = not found when used as dynamically shared library)
** Culprit is FairMultiLinkedData::AddLinks and FairMultiLinkedDataSetLink functions
** The code comples well (FairMultiLinkData is part of libBase )
** At runtime, when libraries try to dynamically link against libBase, code crashes at run time
** The reason seems that the two funcs (AddLink and SetLink) are inline
** some exploration says there are compiler flags to hide/unhide symbols from dynamic linking

** Could be a specificity of OSX that hides inlines by default unless explicity told not to
** Temporary solution is to remove inline modifier from function definitions
** __attribute((visibility(hidden)))__ doesn't seem to work with inline


* undefined symbols for architecture x86_64 error
** Solution couldn't be found, so offending modules were commeted in CMakeLists.txt
** It is caused probably by the library module being compiled to target 32 bits and the client module targeting 64 bit


* TMath was using a deprecated function fininte(double) in OSX-9
** Only solution was to "patch" TMath.h at L503-504 by adding a special case for macosx with no additional condtion on arm that uses std::isfininte()

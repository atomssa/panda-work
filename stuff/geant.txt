  *WARNING*
    Geant4 has been pre-configured to look for datasets
    in the directory:
 
    /Users/tujuba/panda/apr13/share/Geant4-9.6.1/data
 
    but the following datasets are NOT present on disk at
    that location:
 
    G4NDL (4.2)
    G4EMLOW (6.32)
    PhotonEvaporation (2.3)
    RadioactiveDecay (3.6)
    G4NEUTRONXS (1.2)
    G4PII (1.3)
    RealSurface (1.0)
    G4SAIDDATA (1.1)
 
    If you want to have these datasets installed automatically
    simply re-run cmake and set the GEANT4_INSTALL_DATA
    variable to ON. This will configure the build to download
    and install these datasets for you. For example, on the
    command line, do:
 
    cmake -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATA=ON <otherargs>
 
    The variable can also be toggled in ccmake or cmake-gui.
    If you're running on a Windows system, this is the best
    solution as CMake will unpack the datasets for you
    without any further software being required
 
    Alternatively, you can install these datasets manually
    now or after you have installed Geant4. To do this,
    download the following files:
 
    http://geant4.cern.ch/support/source/G4NDL.4.2.tar.gz
    http://geant4.cern.ch/support/source/G4EMLOW.6.32.tar.gz
    http://geant4.cern.ch/support/source/G4PhotonEvaporation.2.3.tar.gz
    http://geant4.cern.ch/support/source/G4RadioactiveDecay.3.6.tar.gz
    http://geant4.cern.ch/support/source/G4NEUTRONXS.1.2.tar.gz
    http://geant4.cern.ch/support/source/G4PII.1.3.tar.gz
    http://geant4.cern.ch/support/source/RealSurface.1.0.tar.gz
    http://geant4.cern.ch/support/source/G4SAIDDATA.1.1.tar.gz
 
    and unpack them under the directory:
 
    /Users/tujuba/panda/apr13/share/Geant4-9.6.1/data
 
    As we supply the datasets packed in gzipped tar files,
    you will need the 'tar' utility to unpack them.
 
    Nota bene: Missing datasets will not affect or break
               compilation and installation of the Geant4
               libraries.

case 1: Run old style (no phi bump splitting and no Brem Correction)
     	    (only run sim_complete.C and digi_complete.C compairison is on DigiComplet time)

case 2: Turn on phi-bump splitting but no brem correction
            (run sim_complete.C, digi_complete.C, reco_complete.C and pid_complete.C - compairison is on DigiComplet time with case 1 and on pid_complete.C time with case 2)

case 3: Turn on both phi-bump splitting and brem correction
     	     (run sim_complete.C, digi_complete.C, reco_complete.C and pid_complete.C - compairison is on DigiComplet time with case 1 and on pid_complete.C time with case 2)

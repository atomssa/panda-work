Example01
=========
  Geant4 ExampleN01 adapted to Virtual Monte Carlo.

  Demonstrates:
    Simple geometry (Gsvolu, Gspos)
    Simple primary generator 
      one geantino with a fixed position and direction
    Access to particle in stepping

  See also description of in 
    geant4/examples/novice/N01/README


Macros:
=======

  For running example with G3:
  
  run_g3.C        - macro for running example 
  g3tgeoConfig.C  - configuration macro for G3 with TGeo geometry (default)
  g3Config.C      - configuration macro for G3 with native geometry 

  For running example with G4:
  
  run_g4.C       - macro for running example 
  g4Config.C     - configuration macro for G4 with native geometry navigation (default)
  g4tgeoConfig.C - configuration macro for G4 with TGeo geometry navigation
  
To run example:
===============
  
  With G3 + TGeo:
  root[0] .x run_g3.C  
  
  With G4:
  root[0] .x run_g4.C  
  
  With G4 + TGeo navigation:
  root[0] .x run_g4.C("g4tgeoConfig.C");  
  

  Note that as geometry is defined via TGeo,
  the example cannot be run with TGeant3 with its native geometry.
  One has to switch to geometry definition via VMC 
  (see test_E01.C)
